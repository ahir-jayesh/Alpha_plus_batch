# JVM (Java Virtual Machine) Architecture

## Java Virtual Machine

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms and are platform-dependent.

### What is JVM

- **Specification**: Defines the working of Java Virtual Machine. Implementation providers are independent to choose the algorithm. Implementation provided by Oracle and other companies.
- **Implementation**: Known as JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
- **Runtime Instance**: An instance of JVM is created whenever the `java` command is used to run a Java class.

### What it does

The JVM performs the following operations:
- Loads code
- Verifies code
- Executes code
- Provides runtime environment

JVM provides definitions for:
- Memory area
- Class file format
- Register set
- Garbage-collected heap
- Fatal error reporting, etc.

## JVM Architecture

### 1) Classloader

Classloader is a subsystem of JVM used to load class files. There are three built-in classloaders in Java:
- **Bootstrap ClassLoader**: Loads the `rt.jar` file containing Java Standard Edition classes.
- **Extension ClassLoader**: Loads JAR files located inside `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext` directory.
- **System/Application ClassLoader**: Loads class files from the classpath. By default, the classpath is set to the current directory.

Example:
```java
public class ClassLoaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class c = ClassLoaderExample.class;
        System.out.println(c.getClassLoader());
        System.out.println(String.class.getClassLoader());
    }
}
```

### 2) Class(Method) Area

Stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods.

### 3) Heap

Runtime data area where objects are allocated.

### 4) Stack

Java Stack stores frames holding local variables and partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return. Each thread has a private JVM stack, created at the same time as the thread.

### 5) Program Counter Register

Contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.

### 6) Native Method Stack

Contains all the native methods used in the application.

### 7) Execution Engine

Contains a virtual processor with:
- **Interpreter**: Reads bytecode stream then executes the instructions.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler**: Improves performance by compiling parts of the byte code that have similar functionality at the same time.

### 8) Java Native Interface

Java Native Interface (JNI) provides an interface to communicate with applications written in other languages like C, C++, Assembly, etc. Java uses JNI framework to interact with OS libraries or send output to the Console.
