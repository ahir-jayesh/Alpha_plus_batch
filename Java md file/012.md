# 1's and 2's Complement Systems

## Introduction

In computer science and digital electronics, the 1's complement and 2's complement systems are methods used to represent signed binary numbers. They offer a way to represent both positive and negative numbers using binary arithmetic.

### 1's Complement

In 1's complement representation, negative numbers are obtained by flipping all the bits (changing 1s to 0s and vice versa) of the corresponding positive number.

### 2's Complement

2's complement representation is similar to 1's complement, but with an additional step: after obtaining the 1's complement, 1 is added to the result. This method eliminates the issue of having two representations for zero in 1's complement and simplifies arithmetic operations.

## Mathematical Operations

### Addition

Adding two binary numbers in 2's complement representation involves the following steps:

1. Add the numbers as if they were unsigned binary numbers.
2. Discard any overflow beyond the number of bits available.
3. If there is a carry out of the most significant bit, it indicates overflow in signed arithmetic.

### Subtraction

Subtraction is achieved by adding the 2's complement of the subtrahend to the minuend. This process is equivalent to adding the minuend and the negation of the subtrahend.

## Examples

### Addition

Let's add two 4-bit binary numbers: `0110` and `1011`.

```
  0110   (6)
+ 1011  (-5)
______
 10001  (Overflow, discard the leftmost bit)
```

The result is `0001`, which represents the decimal value `1`. The overflow indicates that the result is out of range for a 4-bit signed binary number.

### Subtraction

Subtracting `1011` from `0110`:

```
  0110   (6)
- 1011  (-5)
______
  1101  (Overflow, discard the leftmost bit)
```

The result is `1101`, which represents the decimal value `-3`. The overflow again indicates that the result is out of range for a 4-bit signed binary number.

## Conclusion

1's and 2's complement systems provide a way to represent both positive and negative numbers in binary form, enabling arithmetic operations on signed integers. While 2's complement is more commonly used due to its simplicity and elimination of the two representations of zero, understanding both systems is essential for a deeper comprehension of binary arithmetic.
