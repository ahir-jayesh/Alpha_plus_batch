# Unicode System

Unicode is a universal international standard character encoding capable of representing most of the world's written languages. Before Unicode, there were many language standards:

- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) for the United States.
- ISO 8859-1 for Western European languages.
- KOI-8 for Russian.
- GB18030 and BIG-5 for Chinese, and so on.

## Problems

This variety of standards caused two main problems:

1. **Ambiguity**: A particular code value corresponded to different letters in various language standards.
2. **Variable Length Encoding**: The encodings for languages with large character sets had variable lengths. Some common characters were encoded as single bytes, while others required two or more bytes.

## Solution

To address these issues, a new language standard was developed: Unicode. In Unicode, each character is represented by a fixed-size encoding, typically using 2 bytes. This standardization ensures that each character has a unique code point, eliminating ambiguity and simplifying cross-language text processing.

### Why Java Uses Unicode?

Java, being a platform-independent language, relies on Unicode for character representation. By adopting Unicode, Java ensures that its programs can handle text data in various languages consistently across different platforms and systems.

## Unicode Representation in Java

In Java, characters are represented using Unicode. Each character occupies 2 bytes of memory.

### Lowest Value
The lowest value in Unicode is represented as `\u0000`.

### Highest Value
The highest value in Unicode is represented as `\uFFFF`.

These values denote the range of characters that can be represented using the 2-byte Unicode encoding in Java.

Unicode support in Java simplifies internationalization and localization efforts, making Java a preferred choice for developing multilingual applications.

## Conclusion

Unicode's adoption as the universal character encoding standard has significantly simplified text processing and language support in software development. Java's utilization of Unicode ensures that Java programs can handle text data from diverse languages seamlessly, promoting cross-platform compatibility and internationalization.
