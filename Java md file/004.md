# C++ vs Java: A Comparison

## Code Examples

### C++ Program Example

```cpp
// File: main.cpp

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  

int main() {  
    cout << "Hello C++ Programming";  
    return 0;  
}
```

Output:
```
Hello C++ Programming
```

### Java Program Example

```java
// File: Simple.java

class Simple {  
    public static void main(String args[]) {  
        System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }  
}
```

Output:
```
Hello Java
```

## Differences Between C++ and Java

| Comparison Index       | C++                                  | Java                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Platform-independent   | C++ is platform-dependent.           | Java is platform-independent.        |
| Mainly used for        | System programming.                  | Application programming.             |
| Design Goal            | Systems and applications programming. | Application development, network computing. |
| Goto                   | Supports the goto statement.         | Doesn't support the goto statement.  |
| Multiple inheritance   | Supports multiple inheritance.       | Doesn't support multiple inheritance through classes. Can be achieved with interfaces. |
| Operator Overloading   | Supports operator overloading.       | Doesn't support operator overloading. |
| Pointers               | Supports pointers.                   | Supports pointers internally but restricts direct pointer manipulation. |
| Compiler and Interpreter | Compiled using a compiler.        | Compiled to bytecode and interpreted at runtime. |
| Call by Value/Reference | Supports both call by value and call by reference. | Supports call by value only. |
| Structure and Union    | Supports structures and unions.      | Doesn't support structures and unions. |
| Thread Support         | Doesn't have built-in support for threads. | Has built-in thread support.        |
| Documentation comment  | Doesn't support documentation comments. | Supports documentation comments.    |
| Virtual Keyword        | Supports the virtual keyword.       | Doesn't have a virtual keyword; non-static methods are virtual by default. |
| Unsigned right shift   | Doesn't support `>>>` operator.      | Supports `>>>` operator for unsigned right shift. |
| Inheritance Tree       | Always creates a new inheritance tree. | Uses a single inheritance tree with `Object` class as the root. |
| Hardware Interaction   | Closer to hardware.                  | Less interactive with hardware.      |
| Object-oriented        | Object-oriented language.            | Object-oriented language with a single root hierarchy. |
