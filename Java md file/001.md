# Java Tutorial

## Introduction

Our core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals. Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured, and general-purpose computer programming language. It is a widely used robust technology.

### What is Java?

Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high-level, robust, object-oriented, and secure programming language.

Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (now a subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.

**Platform:** Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

## Java Example

Let's have a quick look at a Java programming example. A detailed description of the Hello Java example is available on the next page.

```java
class Simple{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }  
}  
```

### Application

According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:

- Desktop Applications such as Acrobat Reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
- Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
- Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
- Mobile
- Embedded System
- Smart Card
- Robotics
- Games, etc.

## Types of Java Applications

There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:

1. **Standalone Application:** Also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. Examples include media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.

2. **Web Application:** An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page. Technologies such as Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. are used for creating web applications in Java.

3. **Enterprise Application:** Distributed applications such as banking applications. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

4. **Mobile Application:** Applications created for mobile devices. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.

## Java Platforms / Editions

There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:

1. **Java SE (Java Standard Edition):** Java programming platform including core APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math, etc. It covers core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.

2. **Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition):** Enterprise platform mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.

3. **Java ME (Java Micro Edition):** Micro platform dedicated to mobile applications.

4. **JavaFX:** Used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.
